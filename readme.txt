Application for Encryption and Decryption using python (this is a baisc Encrypt and decrypt code. for study purpose only)
source code: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encrypt-and-decrypt-files-using-python/ 
the code was inspired from the above code

i created this for basic encryption and decryption python program. 
At the same time making it a user friendly for their personal use


this program is most commonly 2 file app the python and the textfile.txt
the textfile.txt is the file were we will input the text we want to encrypt( it was suppose to be a csv file but i made it txt for this 
study purpose)
main.py is the program itself.
if there's filekey.key it is most commonly because someone used the program and generate it(it is recommended to create a new one for security purposes and keep it to yourself in case you need it including a 
copy of textfile.txt( to decrypt it ofcourse you need to go bakc to this application to decyper it, place all that you copy(textfile.txt and filekey.key) in this folder))
DONT FORGOT TO INSTALL THE CRYPTOGRAPHY MODULE FOR THIS TO WORK
just type at the terminal or at your cmd pip install cryptography
